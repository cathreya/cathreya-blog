In Monsoon 2020, I did a course on blockchains by [Prof. Sujit Gujar](https://sites.google.com/site/sujitgujar/). An interesting assignment was to come up with a usecase that could be realized using blockchain technology. Our team came up with dCabs, a decentralized cab service on a blockchain. Our unique idea was using the underlying gossip protocol messages to piggyback driver locations to clients. While we are unsure how to acheive this in practice, we did code up a proof of concept in Solidity for the contract (which I will post once the course is done).
