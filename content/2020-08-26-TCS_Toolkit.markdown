I am working through Prof. Ryan O'Donnell's wonderful <a target='_blank' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prI35GmCon4&list=PLm3J0oaFux3ZYpFLwwrlv_EHH9wtH6pnX"> CS Theory Toolkit </a> course. I have been taking handwritten notes for my own reference and understanding. I thought that I would post them here regardless in case someone was interested in reading them.

This currently has my notes from Lecture 1 to 13.
