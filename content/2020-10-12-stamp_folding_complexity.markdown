While going through my old course material, I ran across this video I made for my Complexity Theory course back in Monsoon 2018. I took this course before I really got interested in Theoretical CS. Unfortunately, I didn't go into much detail on how I experimented with the mentioned gadgets and the intuition behind why they exist. Hopefully I can revisit the problem in the future equipped with a better theory toolkit.
