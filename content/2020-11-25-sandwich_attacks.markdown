As part of an assignment in my course on blockchains, I got to read [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14021) by Zhou et. al. The paper primarily talks about a particular kind of attack called sandwich attacks that can be carried out on Decentralized Exchanges. Here I present one such sandwich attack and go over some of the results in the paper. I sacrifice some details to make the presentation more expository, which was the intention of the assignment.
