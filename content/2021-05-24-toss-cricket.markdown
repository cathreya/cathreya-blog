In Spring 2021, I did a course on game theory by [Prof. Sujit Gujar](https://sites.google.com/site/sujitgujar/). One of the assignments in the course was to analyze an everyday usecase using the framework of game theory. At the time, the India-England Cricket test series was going on and there was a lot of debate about how the toss basically decided the game because of how the pitch deteriorated. Motivated by this, we chose to propose alternatives to the traditional coin toss and analyze them game theoretically.
