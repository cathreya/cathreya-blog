In Spring 2020, I did an independent study on discrete geometry. My aim was to gain some exposure to the field and attempt some exercises to test my understanding. I mainly followed Jiřı́ Matoušek's "Lectures on Discrete Geometry". I didn't manage to cover as much as I would have liked, but I have attempted to compress what I did read into this document. All images are courtesy the afforementioned textbook, Prof. Rajiv Raman's lecture notes or drawn by me.
